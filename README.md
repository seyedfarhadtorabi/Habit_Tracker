# Habit_Tracker
object oriented python habit tracker

Case in point

Apps for habit tracking are useful because they provide a visual representation of your progress. You can see an unbroken chain of all the times you've done the habit. If you can see your progress, you're much less likely to skip the habit.

Target

This app shows you if you're on track to meet your goals. You can use this app to determine whether you are on or off target. This will ensure that you always know when and where to work hard to push your limits, and, more importantly, when to relax.

Equipment

We use Python object oriented programming for this app. Furthermore, functional programming aided in the encapsulation of the project's components into habit tracker class, analyzer part, and main part that runs the entire part in this part.

Engagement

o The app allows the user to select up multiple habits. A habit is defined by a task and a frequency.

o A task can be completed, i.e. "checked-off," at any time by a user.

o Each task must be completed at least once during the time period specified by the user for the particular habit. If a user fails to complete a habit within the time frame specified, the habit is said to be broken.

o A streak of x periods is established when a user completes a habit's task for x consecutive periods in a row, i.e., without breaking the habit. For example, if a user commits to working out every day for two weeks, they will have established a 14-day workout streak.

o Users' habits are not only saved but also analysed when they enter them into the app. Users want answers to a variety of questions, such as "how long has my habit streak been?" What is a list of my current daily activities? Which habits did I have the most trouble with last month?
